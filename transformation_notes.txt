Task 12 - Power Query Transformation Notes
Dataset: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance (Kaggle)
Rows/Columns: ~1470 rows, 35 columns originally

Key Transformations:
- Renamed columns e.g. 'MonthlyIncome' kept, 'EmployeeCount' removed
- Removed constant columns: EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours
- Fixed data types: Age, MonthlyIncome, etc. to appropriate types
- Created conditional columns:
  - AgeGroup: Under 25 / 25-35 / 36-45 / 46+
  - SalaryBand: Low (<4k) / Medium (4-8k) / High (8-12k) / Very High
  - AttritionFlag: 1 for Yes, 0 for No
- No major missing values found; replaced any blanks with 'Unknown' where needed
- Observations: Highest attrition in Sales dept, younger employees (25-35) show more attrition when OverTime=Yes
